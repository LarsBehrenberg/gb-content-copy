      ### Isaac Newton was born on Christmas day 1642 in a Lincolnshire manor
      house.


      Newton was named after his recently deceased father (a wealthy farmer) and raised by his maternal grandmother after his mother remarried.


      #### Education and early work


      He did well at school despite or perhaps because of being bullied, and entered Trinity College, [Cambridge](https://thingstodoeverywhere.com/visit-cambridge-attractions.html), in 1661.


      Newton graduated in 1665, the same year as he discovered the binomial mathematical theory, and returned to his childhood home of Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire—when the university was closed because of an outbreak of plague—to develop his theories on optics, mechanics, the law of gravitation and calculus.


      It was during this period that Newton developed his laws of motion. Newton later described these years as the "prime" of his "age for invention".


      #### Principia Mathematica and Opticks


      Newton returned to Cambridge, as a fellow of Trinity College, two years later. He was promoted to be the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669, probably as a result of his invention of the [reflecting telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope) (which brought him to the attention of the scientific establishment) the previous year.

## Newton is probably the most influential scientist in history, though da Vinci, [Darwin](/charles-darwin-biography) and Einstein could make credible claims to this crown.

In a period of about two years, working from a Lincolnshire manor, Newton developed his theory of universal gravitation (which explains why an apple falls to earth, the moon orbits the earth, and the earth orbits the sun), devised his three laws of motion, invented infinitesimal calculus, and made profound advances in the understanding of light.

He spent the rest of his life writing about and refining these theories, publishing *Principia Mathematica*, the most influential science book ever written, and fulfilling a number of important public roles (ranging from being a Member of Parliament, to Master of the Royal Mint, to President of the Royal Society). Oh ... and Newton was a great alchemist!

Newton is the second greatest Briton.
