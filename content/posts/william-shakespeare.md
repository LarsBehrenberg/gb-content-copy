      ### Born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564 to parents John and Mary (an
      alderman and farmer’s daughter respectively), Shakespeare’s early years
      remain somewhat of a mystery to modern scholars.


      What is known is that Shakespeare married [Anne Hathaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hathaway_(wife_of_Shakespeare)) at the age of 18. Hathaway, eight years Shakespeare’s senior, was pregnant at the time with the first of his three children.


      Shakespeare moved to London in the early 1580s and embarked upon his career, becoming an actor and writer for, and the part-owner of, the Lord Chamberlain’s Men (one of the nation’s two leading playing companies, which became the King’s Men after James I awarded it a royal patent in 1603).


      Shakespeare had probably become well known by 1592, following the success of his first play, Henry VI Part One (causing one critic to describe him as an “upstart young crow”). Most of Shakespeare’s surviving works date from between 1589 and 1613, when Shakespeare retired to [Stratford-upon-Avon](https://thingstodoeverywhere.com/visit-birmingham-attractions.html).


      The Chandos portrait, now displayed in Central London’s [National Portrait Gallery](https://www.thingstodoeverywhere.com/central-london-attractions.html#6), is one of the few surviving paintings of Shakespeare. Like Shakespeare’s image, details of his personal life are few and far between: his name appears in a few court records and it is known that he had become wealthy by 1597, buying the second largest house in Stratford.


      But speculation as to his sexuality (fuelled by the content of his [sonnets](#3)) and religious belief abounds.


      Shakespeare died in Stratford-upon-Avon on 23 April 1616, aged 52.

## Few could doubt that Shakespeare—also known as the Bard or England’s national poet—is the foremost English-language writer ever to have lived.

His [38 plays](#2) have been translated into every language and are performed more often than the works of any other playwright. Amongst the most popular are Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and Macbeth.

His [sonnets](#3) are the foremost example of this form of poetry. Schoolchildren everywhere can recite at least some of Sonnet 18 ("Shall I compare thee to a summer's day ...").

And his [continued relevance](#4) is amply demonstrated by the number of his words and phrases that remain in everyday usage: ‘foregone conclusion’, ‘mortal coil’, ‘bated breath’, ‘salad days’, ‘slept a wink’ and ‘all’s well that ends well’ are all Shakespeare’s creations.

Shakespeare is the fifth greatest Briton, ahead of other leading writers [Charles Dickens](/charles-dickens-biography), [Jane Austen](/jane-austen-biography), [JRR Tolkien](/jrr-tolkien-biography) and [JK Rowling](/jk-rowling-biography).
