    text: >-
      ### Churchill was born in Blenheim Palace in 1874, the son of an English
      aristocrat and an American socialite.


      His early life did not hint at the success which was to follow: he did poorly at school, was hindered by a speech impediment, and took three attempts to pass the entrance exams for the Royal Military College.


      #### The army

      When he graduated, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 4th Hussars. With his pay unable to meet his expenses, Churchill embarked on a bold strategy of actively seeking out front line, in particular in Cuba, India and the Sudan, and reporting on the action for the national press.


      Churchill left the army in 1899, and, having failed in his first attempt at election to the House of Commons, went to South Africa as a war correspondent. Here, Churchill’s insatiable desire for action saw him made a prisoner of war; his subsequent escape, and 300-mile journey to safety, made him a national hero for a period.


      #### Churchill gets elected and becomes a minister

      This can only have assisted his political aspirations, and Churchill was duly elected as a conservative member of parliament in 1900.


      But Churchill was an outspoken critic of the government’s policies, and he crossed the floor and became a liberal in 1904. He thereafter served as:


      President of the Board of Trade (introducing pro-worker legislation), Home Secretary (exciting controversy by his actions in the Tonypandy Riot and Siege of Sidney Street in East London) and then,in 1911, First Lord of the Admiralty.


      It was this position he held at the outbreak of the First World War.

## In his ninety years, Churchill accomplished feats which few, if any, will equal.

He is best known for his leadership during the Second World War, galvanizing a country close to defeat and gradually, through "blood, toil, tears and sweat", turning the tide against Nazi oppression. That was his finest hour.

But it would be a mistake to overlook Churchill's other achievements:

- He spent nearly nine years as Prime Minister, 31 years as a minister—promoting important welfare legislation as President of the Board of Trade and playing a key role as Minister of Munitions at the end of the First World War—and 55 years as a member of parliament.
- In his life before politics, he was a fearless cavalry officer awarded 14 campaign medals.
- Over the course of his life he published 10 million words, was awarded the Nobel prize for literature, painted over 500 canvasses, and (some maintain) consumed 20,000 bottles of champagne.

He is the greatest Briton.
