## David Bowie, the iconic British musician and singer/songwriter, introduced the world to his many guises over a career spanning more than four decades, demonstrating his formidable talents as a shapeshifter, innovator and creative extraordinaire.

The legendary singer - behind hits [Rebel, Rebel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Rebel),[Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Heroes%22_(David_Bowie_album)) and [Young Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Americans) - was one of the most influential musicians of all time. Bowie’s record sales, estimated at 140 million albums worldwide, made him one of [the world's best-selling music artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists).

Bowie is widely recognised for his androgynous rock star moniker, Ziggy Stardust, which made him a household name in the early 1970s. Ziggy Stardust’s debut, alongside other artists, marked the end of the 1960s and the hippy movement and a musical transition to glam rock and punk.

Always evolving and never one for keeping the one persona going past its creative conclusion, Bowie retired Ziggy Stardust in 1973. Taking time out from his own music, he produced albums for friends [Lou Reed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Reed) and [Iggy Pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iggy_Pop).

With many strings to his bow including actor, painter, mime-artist, producer, writer, arranger, and collaborator, Bowie, whose acting career predated his commercial breakthrough as a musician, continued to act in both movies and on stage throughout his musical pursuits. He starred in rock musical Absolute Beginners, and playing the part of Jareth, the King of the Goblins, in [Jim Henson's dark fantasy Labyrinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(1986_film)).

The innovative musician also experimented with what he referred to as “plastic soul” in the late 1970s, teamed up with Chic producer [Nile Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_Rodgers) on the 1983 Let’s Dance album in a “blues-rock meets dance format”, pursued hard rock with his band Tin Machine in 1989, and channelled jazz-rock on his last ever album [Blackstar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstar_(album)), released on his 69th birthday, two days before his death on 10 January 2016.

For someone who expressed himself to the fullest and always embraced his uniqueness, Bowie most certainly lived his life to the fullest. His impact on the world and creative industries - everything from entertainments, fashion and arts - has been and continues to be monumental.
