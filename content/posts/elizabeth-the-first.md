      ### Elizabeth I was born to Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn,
      in 1533.


      She was the heir to the throne, Henry’s previous child by Catherine of Aragon (Elizabeth's half sister, Mary) having lost her position on the annulment of Henry’s first marriage.


      But things changed quickly: two and a half years later, Elizabeth’s mother was executed by Henry for treason and her parents’ marriage annulled. And then, in 1537, Jane Seymour (Henry’s third wife) gave birth to Prince Edward. Elizabeth’s claim to the throne looked precarious indeed.


      #### Elizabeth's education


      This did not prevent Elizabeth from being given a good education. She was taught French, Flemish, Italian, Spanish and Latin and has been described as one of the best-educated women of her generation. And, by 1543, Henry had warmed towards his two daughters so much that he had Parliament enact the Succession to the Crown Act 1543. This statute reinstated Mary and then Elizabeth to the line of succession, behind Edward.

## In 1558, Elizabeth became Queen of a country divided along religious lines.

Her father, Henry VIII, had presided over the reformation: establishing the protestant Church of England and parting from the catholic church and holy Roman empire; and abolishing and seizing the property of the monasteries.

But her catholic half-sister, Queen Mary I (also known as Mary Tudor and Bloody Mary), sought to undo much of that change over her five-year reign.

Over the 44 years of her Elizabeth's reign, between 1558 and 1603, the 'virgin Queen' proved a skilful political operator.

Her approach meant that the Church of England became firmly established; that threats from Mary Queen of Scots and the Spanish Armada were overcome; that Shakespeare and Marlow could write prolifically; and that the seeds of empire could be sown by the likes of Francis Drake and by the establishment of the East India Company.

Elizabeth created the conditions that made these achievements possible. She is the eleventh greatest Briton.
