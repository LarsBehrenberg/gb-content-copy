      ### Sebastian Coe was born in Hammersmith, London on the 29th September
      1956, a son to Peter and Angela Coe. He was the oldest of four children
      who were encouraged to play sport by the family.


      When Sebastian was still very young the family moved to Warwickshire where he attended school in Stratford-Upon-Avon, before a further move saw Coe at a comprehensive school in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.


      Although Coe always liked to run, his interest in running and athletics really began to take hold in Sheffield. He was inspired towards the middle distances by his geography teacher David Tomlinson and further fired up after watching the [Mexico Olympics of 1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Summer_Olympics) he joined a local running club, Hallamshire Harriers.


      It was not long before Coe’s potential was there for all to see. Inspired by the Olympics Coe put his name down for a number of running events at his school sports day and won the lot. Sebastian Coe’s father realised his son had enormous potential.


      Peter Cole devised training schedules for his son which saw him win the Yorkshire County cross country championships before finishing tenth in the English schools cross country championships, a race where a certain [Steve Ovett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ovett) was second.


      Aged 16 Coe won the English schools title over 3000 metres, before heading off to [Loughborough University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough_University) to study economics and social history. It was here he would meet coach George Gandy who helped Coe with his conditioning. In 1975 when aged 18 Coe won the Northern counties under 20’s 3000 metres title.

      ### In 1979 Sebastian Coe showcased his talent to the athletics world in
      no uncertain way, when during an incredible 41 days he broke three world
      records.


      He started in Oslo by setting a time of 1:42:33 over 800 metres, before moving on to take the mile and 1500 metre world records as well. With the [1980 Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Summer_Olympics) beckoning Coe had put himself in pole position for gold and a possible middle distance double. Yet as is often the case in sport events do not always go as the form book suggests.


      First up in Moscow was the 800 metres where Coe was a clear favourite. Unfortunately for Coe his rival [Ovett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ovett) had not read the script, taking gold with Coe having to settle for silver, chastising himself for running a tactically poor race.


      However Coe showed admirable desire to bounce back and take gold in the 1500 metres with a blistering final lap of 52.2 seconds. The following year saw the duo battle it out for world records, with the mile record broken three times, firstly by Coe before Ovett snatched it back only to see it claimed by Coe once more.


      The duo did not meet at the inaugura l[IAAF world championships in 1983](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_World_Championships_in_Athletics) as Coe missed them due to ill health. In [1984 Los Angeles hosted the Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Summer_Olympics) but Coe had to settle for second again in the 800 metres with his great rival Ovett down in 7th.


      However, just as in Moscow four years earlier, Coe was up to the task for the 1500 metres, taking the gold in an Olympic record time 3:32:53, with fellow British athlete [Steve Cram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cram) grabbing the silver. With this victory Coe became the first man to defend the 1500 metre title at the Olympics.


      Coe won the European Championships over 800 metres in 1986, but missed out on selection for the 1988 Olympics after a poor run at the trial following a chest infection. Ill health plagued the latter part of this wonderful career and its last major race saw Coe finish 6th in the 800 metres at the [1990 Commonwealth games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Commonwealth_Games). It was time to call it a day and after helping see Britain enjoy its finest decade of middle distance running Sebastian Coe retired from the track.

## Sebastian Coe was a world class middle distance runner, one of the finest track athletes Britain has produced.

Coe was a championship performer, winning two Olympic gold medals, and also possessed the raw speed to be world record holder across a number of distances. His rivalry with fellow British athlete [Steve Ovett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ovett) was must watch sport at its finest.

Coached by his father, Sebastian Coe had a stellar career on the track until injury and illness gradually caught up with him. Following retirement he had a brief stint in politics, becoming an MP and serving a single parliamentary term. Coe returned to the world of sport in an administrative capacity and took great credit for his [Chairmanship of the London Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Organising_Committee_of_the_Olympic_and_Paralympic_Games) bid and the subsequent success of the games themselves.

As President of athletics governing body, [the IAAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Athletics_Federations), Coe has presided over an organisation which has many difficult issues to sort within the sport. Yet it will be his running prowess for which he will be remembered and that timeless footage of his celebrations when crossing the line to win the 1500 metres in Moscow, displaying a mix of sheer elation and relief.
