## Clement Attlee was a post-war Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party for twenty years.

As [Prime Minister](https://greatestbritons.com/clement-attlee-biography.html#3) he oversaw a range of radical social reforms, including extending the welfare state, creation of the National Health Service and nationalisation of major industries. Attlee also granted independence to India as the British Empire moved toward a Commonwealth of nations.

Clement Attlee saw active [service in the first world war](https://greatestbritons.com/clement-attlee-biography.html#1) and loyally served Winston Churchill as Deputy Prime Minister during the second world war. His subsequent landslide [victory over Churchill](https://greatestbritons.com/clement-attlee-biography.html#3) in the election of 1945 was built heavily on providing the British people with a new vision of full employment going forward after the deprivations of the Great Depression of the 1930’s.

Clement Attlee is viewed by many as one of the leading politicians to have ever served the Labour party. Although born in to [a respectable middle-class family](https://greatestbritons.com/clement-attlee-biography.html#1), Attlee’s experience working in the East End of London changed his political stance. During his tenure Labour established themselves as the main alternative for voters to the Conservative Party, with Attlee guiding the nation in a more moderate-left direction.
