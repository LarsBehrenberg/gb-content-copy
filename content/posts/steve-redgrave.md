      ### Steven Geoffrey Redgrave was born 23rd March 1962 in Marlow, a son to
      Geoffrey and Sheila Redgrave.


      #### Early life


      Redgrave attended St Peter’s Street School which he did not enjoy, struggling with dyslexia until he moved to the newly built Burford School where it was recognised by the headmistress. After the 11-plus Redgrave attended Great Marlow Secondary Modern where again he was not terribly happy to begin with. Because of his dyslexia he was having to take extra English lessons instead of learning French.


      Yet in one of those moments which can set you on your future path, head of English and also Redgrave’s form teacher for a year was Francis Smith, who was also captain of [Marlow Rowing Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlow_Rowing_Club).


      Smith asked some of his students if they wanted to try and be in the school rowing team, with Redgrave one of those invited due to the size of his hands and feet which pointed to him becoming a big man in the future and ideal for the sport. The selection process seemed to have its merits though, as 3 of the 12 in the school team went to the 1988 Olympics.


      #### Early career


      Leaving school Steve Redgrave received an unexpected boost to his self-belief when awarded the Best Potential Citizen award from his school. He was also being told he could go on and become a world champion rower and he opted out of further education.


      It was not long before the forecasts were proved correct as Redgrave made his international debut in 1979 in the single sculls at the World Junior Championships. At the same championships one year on Redgrave landed his first medal when taking silver in the double skulls.


      In 1981 Redgrave was to make his senior international debut for Britain in the quadruple scull placing 8th, which was improved upon the following year when finishing 6th. Sculling involves each rower having two oars, one for each hand, but Redgrave decided to switch away from sculling for now. He was to focus on single oar rowing and would soon start his run of consecutive Olympic golds which has made him such a household name in Britain.

## Steve Redgrave was a British rower who won an unprecedented 5 gold medals at 5 consecutive Olympic games between 1984 and 2000.

For an endurance athlete to stay at the pinnacle of their sport for so long is an incredible achievement. Yet Redgrave did so on the back of a [diagnosis of colitis and diabetes](#3) at various points of his career, determined to show you can still achieve sporting success while coping with these conditions.

One of [Britain’s greatest Olympians](#2), Steve Redgrave also has 9 World Championship gold medals to his name, 3 Commonwealth Games golds, 7 World Cup golds and a host of Henley Royal Regatta cups. His power, determination and strategic know-how combined to make him one of the finest rowers the sport has ever seen. Probably not so well known to many is Redgrave also competed in the Bobsleigh during the late 1980’s.

Following retirement from rowing Redgrave has maintained his contact with the sport as a [commentator and ambassador](#3). He shares his unparalleled experience in endurance sport with individuals and groups from across the world and supports a variety of projects.
